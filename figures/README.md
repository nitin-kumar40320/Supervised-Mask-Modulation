# Welcome to the figures directory
This folder contains the figures which have been used in the main README file. If you are here, and you are reading this, we assume:
- You are interested in getting those images for yourself
- You want to know how we created those iamges
- You didn't have anything else to do, so you are just wandering around here to see what we have to present.

In any case, we welcome you here.
Now, since you are already here, why not explore a bit further with us. 

## The bedtime story
### Introduction
Once upon a time, there were a few researchers working on enhancing segmentation tasks. They worked day in and day out to develop a strategy so well curated, that it could perform all sorts of segmentation tasks very well. They initially started with reading a few research papers on current state-of-the-art methodologies. This exploration continued well, onlt till they found the paper which would end up deciding their line of action.
### The Marvellous Reveal
The research paper they found was very attractive. The paper was so overwhelmingly well written, with such an original idea that the two junior researchers were awestruck. The paper introduced a novel mask transformation with a well developed loss function. The paper claimed to stand against the then state-of-art models and generate reasonable result within a fraction of time the other models consumed. The model's visual outputs so appealing that the guys just went mad about reproducing similar outputs. Little did they know, that a realisation was waiting for them to unveil it and understand the hidden secret of the paper they had found.
